# 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas (@tcsimm)

I'm a data enthusiast with a background in Computer Science (MS, Northeastern University) and Information Management & Technology (BS, Syracuse University), and I hold certifications in AWS Cloud and Security (AWS CCP, CompTIA Security+).
I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights that drive real-world decisions across business, technology, and customer analytics.

Over the past year, I’ve built projects that analyze consumer behavior, traffic patterns, airline trends, and hospitality performance using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI. My work combines technical rigor with clear storytelling — from forecasting outcomes to uncovering hidden trends in large datasets.

🧠 **Currently focused on:**  
- SQL optimization and window functions  
- Power BI dashboards for operational reporting  
- Predictive modeling and segmentation  
- Data storytelling for non-technical stakeholders  

📊 **What I’m building toward:**  
A data analyst role where I can help organizations make smarter, data-informed decisions that drive meaningful outcomes and improve overall performance.

🤝 **Open to:**  
Collaborating on analytics projects, contributing to open-source data initiatives, and exploring full-time roles in data analytics or data science.
